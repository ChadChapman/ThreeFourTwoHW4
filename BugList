BUG LIST

need to make sure to only enable count buttons after a successful int parse, not after any value is entered

need to read into a map
	first read into a buffer?
	go line by line
	for each line, read into a queue
	output chars from queue one at a time and put into a char array until a space is reached
	at space evaluate the array of chars
		if either first or last or both indexes are not letters, remove them
		else make the char array a string and match it to a map key, if there is one, if not make it one now
			if it is matched to a map key, increment that counter
	discard the space char
	discard the previous char array contents
	read next char string into the char array and evaluate next word

begin time stamp
read top words into a list and return list
stop time stamp

display return list
return time stamp info
	
	
	// here is where to enqueue it then push through until there is
            // either a letter which is added to the
            // new, refined array, else if it is a space, the array is
            // banked/converted to a string and added to the map
            // else if it is a non letter and or extra space or whatever else,
            // it is dropped
            // !!!! o ri just use arrays and gget it done, this is just text
            // parsing part of it
            // then after that i need a plan for the alg to derive the top n
            // values from the banked string
            // counts that are in the hashmap or treemp
            
            go back to WordParser
